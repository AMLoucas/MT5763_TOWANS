# Problem 4b

# tournament format: a team keeps playing until they accrue 
# 7 wins or 3 losses (whichever comes first - no draws allowed). 
# Assume a fixed win rate p âˆˆ [0, 1] across all rounds
# (they are paired at random).

# Initialisation

#Plot how the total number of matches played (i.e. wins + losses) 
#varies as a function of p.








# Comment on the observed win rate relative to the assumed win rate p 
# (i.e. if a team obtains 2 wins - 3 losses, the maximum likelihood 
# point estimate for their win rate is 40%). Specifically, focus on the
# effect driven by the format of this tournament.
