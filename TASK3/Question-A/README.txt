Investigating the sample variance of a particular sample distribution by Monte Carlo simulations.

Procedures:

[1] Compute the probability of a particular normal distribution greater than a particular uniform distribution.
[2] Use bootstrapping to derive the sample distribution of this probabilities.
[3] Illustrate this sample distribution in a histogram.
[4] Change the number of Monte Carlo simulations and investigate how sample variance would vary with it.
[5] Visualise the relationship between sample variance and number of Monte Carlo simulations.
